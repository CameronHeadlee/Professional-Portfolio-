        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I have have been coding for about two weeks. I like the fact that I can make my ideas come to life through. Although, it has been the most challenging two months of my life I am going to keep working. I never saw coding as a path I would take in life. It was my brother who showed me the benefits of learning this skill. I am motivated to keep learning by the fact that there are so many people in my field more qualified. This means I will have to spend more time perfecting my craft to get to the level I want to be at.</p>
